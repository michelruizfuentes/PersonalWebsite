<!-- this is a subheadline -->
I am a rising sophomore attending Smith College in Northampton, MA. I am fascinated about development, research, equity and social impact. I am pursuing a Statistical and Data Science major and Government minor. I aspire to lead revolutionary initiatives, rooted in the common good, to tackle today's most pressing social and technical challenges and inequities.
