<!-- this is a subheadline -->
My name is Michel (pronounced Mi-SHEL), and I'm from Washington, D.C. I am a rising sophomore at Smith College, located in Northampton, Massachusetts. I am proud of my activism, community organizing, and research that ranges from global affairs to physiology and neurobiology to statistics and data science. I aspire to lead revolutionary initiatives rooted in the common good to tackle today's most pressing social and technical challenges.
