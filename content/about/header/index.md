Hello! My name is Michel Ruiz-Fuentes, and I'm Salvadore√±a from Washington, D.C. I am a rising sophomore at Smith College studying Government and Statistical and Data Science. 

I am skilled in community organzing, leading advocacy intiatives, and pursuing research. I have conducted research in a plethora of fields from global affairs and international conflict (2018) to physiology and neurobiology (2019) to recenty finishing investigations in statistics and data analytics (2021). 
 
I am passionate about international development, equity and using technology for social good. I am fascinated by the intersection of civic engagement and technology, and look forward to exploring opportunities and careers in this field.
