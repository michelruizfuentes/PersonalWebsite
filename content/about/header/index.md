<!-- this is a subheadline -->
I am a Salvadore√±a Americana and Washington, D.C native. My cultural roots, upbringing, and community values have been crucial in shaping my activism and strengthening my ambition. I am fascinated about development, research and social impact. I explore these passions in my Statistical and Data Science and Government studies at Smith College. I aspire to lead revolutionary initiatives, rooted in the common good, to tackle today's most pressing social and technical challenges and inequities.
