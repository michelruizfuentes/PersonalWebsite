<!-- this is a subheadline -->
My name is Michel (pronounced Mi-SHEL), and I'm Salvadoreña from Washington, D.C. I am a rising sophomore at Smith College with the tentative studies of governance and statistical and data science. I am passionate about activism, community organizing, and research. I’ve conducted research in a plethora of fields from international conflict and neurobiology to statistics and data analytics. I aspire to lead revolutionary initiatives rooted in the common good to tackle today's most pressing social and technical challenges.
